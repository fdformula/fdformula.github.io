# Mathly Turns Lua into a Tiny, Free but Powerful MATLAB

Mathly for [Lua](https://www.lua.org) is a Lua module which turns Lua into a tiny, free but powerful MATLAB. It provides a group of commonly
used MATLAB functions and features, for example,  `linspace`, `zeros`, `rand`, `save`, `plot`, `plot3d`, and convenient matrix operations
as well. If there are things many love the most about MATLAB, these tools are. They make coding and testing a thought much
easier and faster than working in most other programming languages.

Mathly uses Plotly JavaScript graphing tools (see https://plotly.com/javascript/) to plot graphs. Therefore, graphs are
shown in an internet browser.

The entire mathly tool together with Lua interpreter is less than 5 MB, while providing enough features for instructors and college students
to implement numerical algorithms. Because it is super lightweight and fast as well, it can run fast even on old and slow devices like 
Microsoft Surface Pro 4 (Intel Core i5-6300U with 8 GB RAM). In contrast to it, MATLAB needs a few GB of storage space. In addition, 
it takes about 22 seconds to start MATLAB R2024b on a brand new high-end Intel Core i9-14900HX laptop with 56 GB RAM. Thus, it can hardly 
be installed on slow or pretty old computers and run smoothly.

Mathly is especially a good choice for instructors of linear algebra and numerical computing for teaching. It takes no time to
start Lua with mathly loaded. While developing code and doing computation in a lecture, they can simply focus on delivery
of course contents and never need to worry if their computers work too slowly. Moreover, Lua is so
simple and so natural a language that students without programming skills can understand most of Lua code.

## Which version of Lua is needed?

Mathly is developed in Lua 5.4.6. It works with the present newest version 5.4.7. It might work with previous versions.

You may download Lua source code in https://lua.org/ and compile it yourself or simply download prebuilt binary commands
for Microsoft Windows in, say, https://joedf.github.io/LuaBuilds/ and https://www.nuget.org/packages/lua/. Another way to get prebuilt Lua is to download
ZeroBrane Studio (https://studio.zerobrane.com/), a lightweight Lua IDE for various platforms. It comes with multiple versions of Lua.

Microsoft Windows users may download in [Mathly](https://github.com/fdformula/MathlyLua) the file, `cudatext-for-mathly-win-*.7z`, including Lua 5.4.6.
Run [7zip](https://7-zip.org/) to extract it to C:/ . [CudaText](https://cudatext.github.io/) is a very good "IDE" for Lua and running mathly as well.
Quite a few CudaText plugins are included. Some are customized and even have new features added. While in CudaText, press
```
  F1               to open help document on current Lua/mathly function

  F2               to start Lua interpreter with mathly loaded
  Ctrl-,           to run the command on current line or selected code in the editor
  Ctrl-.           to run all code in the editor (HTML file? open it in a browser)

  Ctrl-Alt-Space   to trigger auto (Lua/mathly) lexical completion
  Shift-Alt-Space  to trigger auto text completion (Ctrl-p d, load an English dictionary as part of the text)
```
`F2`, `Ctrl-,`, and `Ctrl-.` work with Bash, Julia, Octave, Python, R, Ruby, and some other languages with interactive REPL terminal.
CudaText detects and selects the very language according to the extension of the present filename (defaults to Lua). See: The first few
lines of the file, `C:\cygwin\cudatext\py\cuda_ex_terminal\__init__.py`.

Other hotkeys? Refer to `C:\cygwin\cudatext\cudatext-hotkeys-for-plugins.txt`.

## Where to place the downloaded files?

The files may be placed in either

### 1. the folder of your Lua script files to run/test or

### 2. (Windows) the folder, e.g., c:/cygwin/bin/, which contains the command, `lua.exe`:
```
lua.exe
browser-setting.lua
mathly.lua
plotly-2.9.0.min.js
```
###  (Linux) /usr/local/share/lua/5.4/
You may need to edit the file `browser-setting.lua`. See comments in the file.

Note: The *.lua files can be compiled with `luac`. To use compiled modules, we set `package.path` first as follows:

```Lua
package.path = "./?.luac;;"
```

## Two important things you need to know

### 1. A mathly matrix is a table (of tables), but a table may not be a mathly matrix.

#### a. Mathly 'constructor', `diag`, `expand`, `flipfr`, `flipud`, `horzcat`, `lu`, `ones`, `zeros`, `rand`, `randi`, `randn`, `remake`, `reshape`, `submatrix`, `vertcat`, `cc`, `rr`, and matrix operations can generate mathly matrices.
```Lua
mathly = require('mathly')
a = mathly{{1, 2, 3}, {2, 3, 4}}   -- a, b, c, d, A, B, C, D, and E are all mathly matrices
b = {{1}, {2}, {3}}; b = mathly(b) -- or simply b = cc{1, 2, 3}
c = mathly(1, 10, 5)
d = mathly(1, 10, 0)      --  same as f = mathly(zeros(1, 10)) or rr(zeros(1, 10))
A = mathly(10, 10)
B = mathly(1, 10)
C = randi(100, 10, 1)     -- a column vector of random integer numbers (from 1 to 100)
D = rand(10, 2)           -- a 10x2 matrix of random numbers (from 0 to 1)
E = reshape(C, 3)         -- a 3x4 matrix; 4 is determined by mathly

-- inv(A) * B             -- not allowed as in math
inv(A) * B^T
inv(A) * seq(1, 10)       -- mathly knows how to handle a Lua table seq(1, 10)
seq(1, 10) * inv(A)       -- here in its context
rr(seq(1, 10)) * inv(A)   -- or you can have full control by using rr or cc

A = randi(100, 10, 5)
B = randi(100, 5, 3)
C = rand(3, 1)
A * B * C
C^T * B^T

A = randi({50, 100}, 3)
B = randi({0, 10}, 3)
C = 3 * A - 4 * B + 5
D = A .. B .. C           -- concatenate matrices A, B, and C horizontally, same as horzcat(A, B, C)
disp(D)
E = A .. cc{1, 2, 3}
disp(E)

-- matrix/table "division" is elementwise, provided for convenience only
x = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
rr(x) / 10
1 / (2 * rr(x) + 1)
x / cc(cos(x))

A = mathly{{1, 2}, {3, 4}}
1 / A
{{2, 3}, {4, 5}} / A
```
#### b. `ones`, `zeros`, `rand`, `randi`, and `randn` generate each an ordinary table rather than a mathly matrix if used this way, say, `ones(1, 100)`.
This allows us to generate a table of specified length and address it conveniently like `x[i]` instead of `x[1][i]`.

#### c. Mathly matrix operations can only be applied on mathly matrices; if a matrix operation involves two objects, one must be a mathly matrix.

To allow matrix operations on ordinary tables, conversion is needed. For example,

```Lua
mathly = require('mathly')
x = linspace(0, pi, 10)   -- x, y, and z are not mathly matrices/vectors.
y = cos(x)
z = sin(x)
-- 3 * y                  -- not allowed/defined
-- y + z                  -- not allowed/defined
mathly(y) + z             -- y + mathly(z), or mathly(y) + mathly(z) -- at least one must be a mathly matrix
2 * rr(y) - 3 * rr(z)     -- both y and z must be converted to mathly matrices
```

### 2. A mathly row/column vector is a matrix.

Its ith element must be addressed by either `x[i][1]` (a column vector) or `x[1][i]`
(a row vector), while the ith element of an ordinary/raw Lua table is addressed by `x[i]`, the way we human beings do math.

**Mathly tries its best to allow us to write math expressions as we usually write.** If you want full control, you can use
`cc` or `rr` to convert an ordinary Lua table to a column or row vector as in the following example.
```Lua
a = randi({-10, 10}, 3, 1) * {1, 2, 3}  -- (3x1 matrix) * (1x3 matrix) --> 3x3 matrix
disp(a)
b = randi({-10,10}, 3, 1) * cc{1, 2, 3} -- (3x1 matrix) * (3x1 matrix) --> (3x1 matrix) .* (3x1 matrix) = 3x1 matrix in MATLAB
disp(b)
```
By the way, `tt` converts a mathly matrix to a table columnwisely or flattens any other table first and returns a specified slice of the resulted table.

## 2D and 3D graphs

### Some examples
```Lua
require 'mathly'
x = linspace(0, pi, 100)
y1 = sin(x)
y2 = map(math.cos, x)
y3 = map(function(x) return x^2*math.sin(x) end, x)

specs1 = {layout={width=700, height=900, grid={rows=4, columns=1}, title='Example'}}
specs2 = {color='blue', name='f2', layout={width=500, height=500, grid={rows=4, columns=1}, title='Demo'}}
specs3 = {width=5, name='f3', style=':', color='cyan', symbol='circle-open', size78}

plot(math.sin, '--r') -- plot a function
shownotlegend()
plot(x, y1) -- plot a function defined by x and y1
plot(x, y1, '--xr', x, y2, ':g', text(0.79, 0.71 - 0.08, 'A'), point(0.79, 0.71, {symbol='circle', size=10, color='blue'}))
plot(x, y1, {xlabel="x-axis", ylabel="y-axis", color='red'})
showlegend()
plot(x, y1, x, y2, specs1, math.sin, '--r')
plot(x, y1, specs3, x, y2, specs2, math.sin, x, y3, specs1)

axisnotsquare()
plot(rand(125, 4)) -- plots functions defined in each column of a matrix with the range of x from 0 to # of rows
plot(rand(125, 4),{layout={width=900, height=400, grid={rows=2, columns=2}, title='Demo'}, names={'f1', 'f2', 'f3', 'g'}})

plot(polarcurve2d(function(t) return t*math.cos(math.sqrt(t)) end, {0, 35*pi}))

axissquare()
do
  local function x(t) t = 3 * t; return math.cos(t)/(1 + math.sin(t)^2) end
  local function y(t) t = 5 * t; return math.sin(t)*math.cos(t)/(1 + math.sin(t)^2) end
  plot(parametriccurve2d({x, y}, {0, 2*pi}, '-g', 150, true)) -- true: show orientation of a parametric curve
end

do -- https://plotly.com/python/3d-surface-plots/
  local a, b, d = 1.32, 1, 0.8
  local c = a^2 - b^2
  local u, v = linspace(0, 2*pi, 100), linspace(0, 2*pi, 100)
  local function x(u, v) return (d * (c - a * cos(u) * cos(v)) + b^2 * cos(u)) / (a - c * cos(u) * cos(v)) end
  local function y(u, v) return b * sin(u) * (a - d*cos(v)) / (a - c * cos(u) * cos(v)) end
  local function z(u, v) return b * sin(v) * (c*cos(u) - d) / (a - c * cos(u) * cos(v)) end
  plotparametricsurface3d({x, y, z}, {0, 2*pi}, {0, 2*pi})
end
```

### Note
1. Part of modules dkjson.lua, http://dkolf.de/dkjson-lua, and plotly.lua, https://github.com/kenloen/plotly.lua,
is merged into this project to reduce dependencies and make it easier for users to download and use mathly. Though
some changes have been made, full credit belongs to the original authors for whom the author of mathly
is very grateful.

1. This project was started first right in the downloaded code of the Lua module, matrix.lua, found
in https://github.com/davidm/lua-matrix/blob/master/lua/matrix.lua, to see if Lua is good for
numerical computing. However, it failed to solve numerically a boundary value problem. The solution
was obviously wrong because the boundary condition at one endpoint is not satisfied, but I could not find
anything wrong in both the algorithm and the code. I had to wonder if there were bugs in the module. In many
cases, it is easier to start a small project from scratch than using and debugging others' code. In
addition, matrix.lua addresses a column vector like a[i][1] and a row vector a[1][i], rather than a[i]
in both cases, which is quite ugly and unnatural. Furthermore, basic plotting utility is not provided in
matrix.lua. Therefore, this mathly module was developed. But anyway, I appreciate the work in matrix.lua.
Actually, you may find some similarities in the code of matrix.lua and mathly.lua, e.g., m1, m2 are used
to name arguments of some functions.
